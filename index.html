      There are so many <em>fun</em> activities to do in fall! Once autumn
      approaches, there are many fun things to do with
      <strong>family and friends.</strong> One example is pumpkin picking!
      Visiting a pumpkin patch with family and friends can be so fun, and after
      picking out pumpkins, there are <strong> many options</strong> relating to
      what to do with them, such as making pumpkin soup or pie, or decorating or
      carving the pumpkins. As well as this, other activities include visiting
      <em>haunted houses</em>, going <em>trick or treating</em>, and
      <em>picking out a halloween costume!</em>
